Terms:
    Container image: self packaged app as image, the image is stored in container registry and can be deployied to any system that support containerization
    Container: a running instance of an image, has its own filesystem, network interface and resources
    Container registry: platform to store and distribute container images
    Multi-architecture: the image can run on multiple CPU architectures (linux/amd64, linux/arm64, windows/amd64) 
                        references to binaries and libraries compiled for multiple CPU architectures
                        

            
Multi-Stage Builds in Docker for Cost Savings: by reducing the image size we have lower cost of storage, faster spinup of image
                                               two-stage build process: "builder" and "runner"

                                               Step 1: builder
                                                       download base image
                                                       install system dependencies
                                                       copies requirments.txt and install packages as wheels
                                               Runner:
                                                        download base image
                                                        install system dependencies
                                                        copy wheel files from the builder stage
                                                        installs Python packages
                                                        copies the application code
                                                        exposes the application's port
                                                        set the startup command
                        
Docker compose: used to deploy multiple services together
                
                Use custom network to deploy services under the same network
                services under the same custom network can cummunicate with service name
                services outside of the custom network cannot reach apps in the custom network

                By configuring volumes ensuring that the data persist even if the pod is killed, stoppped or deleted


                docker-compose build: build the apps in compose file
                docker-compose up: run the apps
                docker-compose down: remove the containers, networks, volumes

Upload to ECR repo:

            1.Move to project folder
            2.aws ecr create-repository --repository-name fastapi-microservices
            3. Authendicate docker to ecr with aws credentials
                aws ecr get-login-password \
                --region ${AWS_REGION} | docker login \
                --username AWS \
                --password-stdin ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com
            4. Tag the image:  docker tag ...
            5. Push the image: docker push

            99. docker pull: pull an image from ecr to local docker env

ECR repos in docker-compose:

            In docker compose file add the imge element to be the image in ecr ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/fastapi-microservices:${IMAGE_VERSION}


    
Build multy-architecture docker images:

        Use docker buildx
